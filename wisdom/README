All files in this directory were generated by running fftw-wisdom using a .nexe
(directly created, or translated from the .pexe) built by the naclports build
of FFTW.

The files are named like this:

  <arch>.<precision>.<x?>.wisdom

  arch: i686 | x86-64 | pnacl
  precision: float | double
  x: (whether the -x flag was used; i.e. exhaustive search)

The command to rebuild these files:

  fftw-wisdom -v \
      rob256x256 rof256x256 \
      rob384x384 rof384x384 \
      rob512x512 rof512x512

Add "-x" for exhaustive wisdom, and rename to "fftwf-wisdom" for float
precision.
